# Learning Inverse Skill From Forward Demonstrations

Given a set of demonstrations for a particular skill, this project aims to understand the underlying skill and learn the inverse skill using RL by creating an internal environment that rewards the robot for undoing the forward skill's effects. 
This ongoing research is a part of the EU-funded INVERSE project.
